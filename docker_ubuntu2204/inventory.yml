# This is an inventory file for Ansible, which defines the hosts and groups for managing infrastructure.
# It provides a structured representation of the target systems, allowing Ansible to execute tasks on specific hosts or groups of hosts.

# Example Inventory:

---
all:
  hosts:
    server1:
      ansible_host: <IP_ADDRESS_SERVER1>
    server2:
      ansible_host: <IP_ADDRESS_SERVER2>
