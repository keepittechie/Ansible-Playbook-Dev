# Ansible Playbooks for Home Lab

This repository contains a collection of Ansible playbooks and related resources for managing and automating tasks in my home lab. The playbooks are designed to help improve skills in the IT field and can also be useful for others on their own journey.

## About Me

My name is Josh, and I am an IT enthusiast passionate about technology and continuous learning. I have created a home lab environment to further develop my skills and explore various IT concepts. I document my experiences and share tutorials on my YouTube channel, [KeepItTechie](https://www.youtube.com/KeepItTechie).

To use the Ansible playbooks in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that you have Ansible installed on your system. If not, you can refer to the [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html) for installation instructions.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

## Usage

Before running the playbooks, make sure to update the inventory file (inventory.yml) with the appropriate details of your home lab environment. The inventory file should contain the hostnames or IP addresses of the target machines you want to manage with Ansible.

Once the inventory file is updated, you can execute the desired playbook using the following command:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
  ```

Replace playbook.yml with the name of the playbook you wish to run.
